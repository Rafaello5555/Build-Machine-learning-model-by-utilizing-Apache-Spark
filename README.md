# Build-Machine-learning-model-by-utilizing-Apache-Spark
We can interact with  Spark by using different languages such as Python,R, Scala, Java.  I have used Python in this project. The project is about  developing  a model which will predict whether or not a given flight will be delayed. The data contain  50000 records. 

 Data dictionary:
mon — month (integer between 1 and 12)
dom — day of month (integer between 1 and 31)
dow — day of week (integer; 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday)
org — origin airport 
mile — distance (miles)
carrier — carrier 
depart — departure time (decimal hour)
